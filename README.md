# Spectrum-Sensing

Here are the MATLAB codes for spectrum sensing project done under MATHS F366: Laboratory Project.
This is a study of different Spectrum Sensing methods such as Energy Detection and Matched Filter Detection. 
It uses 3 types of modulation techniques that are QPSK, BPSK and 64-QAM.
We have also performed a comparitive study between AWGN noise channel and Rayleigh fading channel.

Conclusion: 64-QAM is the best modulation Technique, Energy Detection method outperforms the Matched filter detection method and AWGN channel has lesser chances of error as compared to Rayleigh channel.
